--[[
	worm game
	
	2 scenes
	-Eating/Attacking Scene
	-Building Scene

	In attacking, you go around controlling a worm creature (flash game style) attempting to eat buildings and maybe kill some people
	Small enemies try and shoot you, either walking around on the ground or standing on buildings
	They should be pretty easy to kill
	Perhaps have versions that do not attack and instead run away
	
	Once you are done (dead? time ran out?) a small cutscene plays where you spit out the buildings you ate and it transitions
	
	To building scene
	Where you have your own little people and you place the buildings you ate for them
	once your town is complete you finish the game?
	perhaps buildings can give you some form of upgrades as well
